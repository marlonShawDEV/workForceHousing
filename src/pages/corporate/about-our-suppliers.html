      <p>Through our Supplier Diversity program, we've supported diversity in contracting for more than 25 years — awarding millions of dollars in contracts to diverse suppliers that provide the highest quality products and services at the most competitive prices. </p>
      <p>We welcome all qualified diverse suppliers to consider Freddie Mac's potential sourcing opportunities. To determine your eligibility, review our Diverse Supplier qualifications and definitions, as well as the types of products and services we purchase. If you meet the minimum requirements outlined below, we encourage you to complete our Supplier Profile Questionnaire.</p>
      <p>As a Freddie Mac Diverse Supplier, we'll forward your information to Procurement or a business area representative for review when your products and services match our needs. This offers you maximum exposure and allows your firm to be considered, whenever appropriate, on competitive bids.  Submitting the Supplier Profile Questionnaire facilitates your potential association with Freddie Mac, but does not guarantee a bid solicitation or contract award. </p>
      <p>Diverse Suppliers are encouraged to contact Supplier Diversity to inquire about potential contracting opportunities.</p>
